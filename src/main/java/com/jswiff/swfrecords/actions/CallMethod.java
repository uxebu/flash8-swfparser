 * Performed stack operations (e.g. for a method <code>myObject.myMethod(arg1,
 * arg2, ..., argn))</code>:<br>
 * <code>pop instance</code> (the instance this method is invoked on, e.g. <code>myObject</code>)<br>
 * <code>pop name</code> (the method name, e.g. <code>"myMethod"</code>)<br>

 * <code>pop arg2</code> (second argument)<br>
 * <code>...<br>
 * pop argn</code> (nth argument)<br>
 * <code> push result<br>
 * </code> The instance the method is invoked on has to be pushed to the stack
 * before method invocation e.g. like this:<br>
 * <code>push &quot;myObject&quot;<br>
 * GetVariable<br>
 * </code> If the method has no result, <code>undefined</code> is pushed. In
 * this case, use <code>Pop</code> to discard it.

 * ActionScript equivalent: method invocation using dot syntax
