 * <p>
 * This action makes the target sprite draggable, i.e. it makes sure users can
 * drag it to another location.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: Only one sprite can be dragged at a time. The sprite remains draggable
 * until it is explicitly stopped by <code>ActionStopDrag</code> or until
 * <code>StartDrag</code> is called for another sprite.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Performed stack operations:<br>
 * <code>pop sprite</code> (the sprite to be dragged)<br>
 * <code>pop lockCenter</code> (if nonzero, mouse is locked to sprite center,
 * otherwise it is locked to the mouse position at the time the dragging started)<br>
 * <code>pop constrain</code> (if nonzero, four values which define a
 * constraint window are popped off the stack)<br>
 * <code>pop y2</code> (bottom constraint coordinate)<br>
 * <code>pop x2</code> (right constraint coordinate)<br>
 * <code>pop y1</code> (top constraint coordinate)<br>
 * <code>pop x1</code> (left constraint coordinate)<br>
 * Constraint values are relative to the coordinates of the sprite's parent.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * ActionScript equivalents: <code>startDrag()</code>,
 * <code>MovieClip.startDrag()</code>
