/**
 * <p>
 * With this tag, an instance of a character can be added to the display list.
 * Besides, unlike <code>PlaceObject</code>, it can modify the attributes of a
 * character that is already on the display list.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The only mandatory attribute is the character depth. A character that is
 * already on the display list can be identified by its depth alone, as there
 * can be only one character at a given depth. If a new character is added to
 * the display list, the character ID is needed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the <code>move</code> flag is set, the character at the given depth is
 * removed. If no character ID is set, the removed character is redisplayed at
 * the same depth with new attributes. If the character ID is set, the
 * corresponding character replaces the removed one.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A transform matrix and a color tranform can be specified in order to
 * determine the position, rotation, scale and color of the character to be
 * displayed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The morph ratio applies to characters defined with
 * <code>DefineMorphShape</code> and specifies how far the morph has
 * progressed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A (non-zero) clip depth indicates that the character is a clipping character
 * which masks depths up to and including the specified value (e.g. if a
 * character was placed at depth 1 with a clip depth of 4, all depths above 1,
 * up to and including depth 4, will be masked by the shape placed at depth 1;
 * characters placed at depths above 4 will not be masked).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The character instance can be given a name which it can later be referenced
 * by (e.g. within <code>With</code>).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, if the character to be placed is a sprite, one or more event
 * handlers (clip actions) can be defined.
 * </p>

 * @see PlaceObject
 * @see DefineMorphShape
