/**
 * <p>
 * This tag assigns a certain name to the current frame. This name can be used
 * by <code>GoToLabel</code> to identify this frame.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As of SWF 6, labels can additionally be defined as named anchors for better
 * browser integration. Named anchors are similar to HTML anchors (i.e.
 * fragment identifiers, as specified in RFC 2396). If the named anchor is
 * supplied at the end of the SWF file's URL (like
 * <code>http://servername/filename.swf#named_anchor</code>) in the browser,
 * the Flash Player plugin starts playback at the frame labeled as
 * <code>named_anchor</code>. Additionally, if the Flash Player plugin
 * encounters a frame containing a named anchor during playback of an SWF, it
 * adds the anchor to the URL of the HTML page embedding the SWF in the
 * address bar (or updates it if an anchor is already there), so the frame can
 * be bookmarked and the browser's "back" and "forward" buttons can be used
 * for navigation.
 * </p>

 * @since SWF 3 (named anchors since SWF 6)
